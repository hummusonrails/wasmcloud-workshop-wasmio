# Wasm I/O 2025: Getting Started with Wasmcloud

This repository contains everything you need to get started with the workshop:

## ðŸ‘· Workshop

In this workshop, we'll build two wasmCloud components:

1. **NuBase**, an experimental database powered by Couchbase and written in Go.

2. A simple HTTP server written in Rust, responding with a friendly greeting.

By the end of the workshop, we will:

- Examine the HTTP & Couchbase native WebAssembly Interface Type ("WIT") interfaces
- Build a HTTP API [WebAssembly-native database component][wasmcloud-docs-component], powered by [Couchbase][couchbase] in Go
- Build a HTTP server component in Rust
- Run your database implementation locally with [wasmCloud][wasmcloud]

If using GitHub Codespaces, just click on the button above, and if you already have a GitHub account, you can get into an environment that "just works"!

> [!NOTE]  
> This link will open a Codespace in the `workshop` branch, which is the branch that contains incomplete code that we'll be building during the workshop. 

### Devcontainers

To use [GitHub devcontainers][devcontainers] to run this project, you can run

```console
just start-devcontainer
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you prefer to *not* use [`just`][just], run `devcontainer up --workspace-folder .`
>
> See [`Justfile`](./Justfile) for more recipes and the commands they run.

You can easily check which tools are not installed by running:

```console
just check
```

Once you have all required tools installed, you can build the project by running:

```console
just build
```

Then, start Couchbase, using `docker compose`:

```console
just start-couchbase
```

Deploy individual components using `wash`:

```console
wash app deploy /path/to/component/wadm.yaml
```

From here, you can start developing the component:

```console
just dev
```
